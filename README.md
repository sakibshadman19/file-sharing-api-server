## Introduction

Introducing the File Upload and Management API: a handy tool for uploading, downloading, and organizing your files. It's user-friendly, with features for uploading different file types. When you upload a file, you get two keys – a public key to share files and a private key to control and delete them.
To keep things fair, the API has limits. You can upload a maximum of 6 files at a time. Additionally, you are allowed to upload files up to 10 times a day and download files up to 10 times a day. Plus, it takes care of cleanup by automatically deleting files that haven't been touched for about 7 minutes.
This API is your go-to solution for easy and secure file management, making sharing, downloading, and cleaning up files a breeze. Welcome to a better way of handling your files with the File Upload and Management API!
